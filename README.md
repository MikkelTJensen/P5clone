This is the code for the P5 project that worked with the topic of Predicting Effects of COVID-19 PreventiveMeasures Using Regression Models by the group 504e20.
Most of the code is written in python and some in R.

## 3 iterations
The first being the code for the exploration phase and is quite messy.
The second is the where the neural network and the certainty system was developed.
The third being a cleaning up and tweaking on the existing code.

## Running the code
For the most succes of running the code the third iteration is prefereed.
There is a main.py in the folder third_iteration that can be run to run the system.
The list of python libraries needed:
- numpy
- psycopg2
- csv
- math
- matplotlib
- pandas
